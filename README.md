This was a project to test my ability to apply python loops to an indirect mathematical function. The prime list is generated by the sieve of Eratosthenes, implemented by utilizing special cases for 2 and 3, then mostly factors of 3 with a few exceptions tested by moduli. The code trims down the prime list whenever it invalidates a prime for being greater than the target value, or already applied to the original target number, so that it cuts down on iterations. This is my attempt at incorporating memory retention. This results in a time complexity of O(n log(log(n)))) with some inaccuracy at higher numbers where the Sieve of Eratosthenes fails.
